# Serotyping
Scripts for serotyping S. pneumoniae.

These scripts are used to analyze S. pneumoniae cpsB sequences and WGS assemblies in order to determine the serotype.

Blast Sequetyping
This script performs blast of cpsB sequences on local cpsB database or online NCBI database. All fasta files must be placed in a "Query" directory located in the "Blast Sequetyping" directory. Then just run the BLAST_cpsB.py script.

Blast WGS
This script performs blast of WGS assemblies on local cps database. All fasta files must be placed in a "Query" directory located in the "Blast WGS" directory. Then just run the BLAST_WGS.py script.
